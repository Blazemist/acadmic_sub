update #1

finished creating sample table maker for each days
the sub_sample_data_maker file uses random module create a random combination of classes and teaching staffs
to create a complex combinations of teachers with free periods, with multiple class, with singuluar class.
This will be very usefull in testing out the teacher substitution program.

update #2
created the 1st ui of the program (using claude ai for the widget placement)
user ui file accesses the timetable and absenties from the user for the name program.
the user is given the choice to simply click the absentee in scrollable area or manually type their name in the manual area.

next stop is considering if "select all" option should be there or not , as well as create a main program that loads this
user_ui.html file to collect data then process it (in python)
and finally give output( most likely using html again)
